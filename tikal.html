                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Tikal was one of the most powerful cities of the Maya civilization, flourishing between the 6th
                        and 9th centuries AD. During its peak, Tikal served as a political, economic, and military
                        center. The city was abandoned in the 10th century, and its network of temples and palaces was
                        covered by jungle for centuries..</p>
